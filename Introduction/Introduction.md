# Introduction

The Azure platform is a cloud computing service provided by Microsoft. It offers a variety of services and features that can be used to create, manage, and deploy applications and services in the cloud. The Azure AZ-900 exam is designed to test your understanding of the basic concepts of the Azure platform. In this article, we will cover some of the key concepts that you should know when preparing for the AZ-900 exam.

Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing resources over the internet. Azure is a cloud computing service that offers various types of computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking services. Cloud computing offers several benefits such as flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

Azure Services
Azure offers a wide range of services, including:

Virtual Machines: This service enables you to create and manage virtual machines in the cloud. Virtual machines provide you with the flexibility to run different types of operating systems and applications.

Azure App Service: This is a fully managed platform that enables you to build, deploy, and scale web, mobile, and API applications.

Azure Storage: This service provides you with secure and scalable cloud storage for your data.

Azure Functions: This is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without having to manage infrastructure.

Azure SQL Database: This is a fully managed relational database service that provides you with high availability and scalability.

Azure Cosmos DB: This is a fully managed NoSQL database service that enables you to store and manage large volumes of data.

Azure Resource Manager
Azure Resource Manager is a management service that enables you to create, deploy, and manage resources in Azure. It provides a unified management experience for all Azure resources, including virtual machines, storage accounts, and networking services. You can use Azure Resource Manager to create templates that define the resources you need for your applications.

Azure Subscriptions
An Azure subscription is a logical container for Azure resources. It enables you to access and manage Azure services and resources. You can create multiple subscriptions and assign different roles to users or groups to manage access to the resources.

Azure Resource Groups
Azure Resource Groups are logical containers that enable you to group Azure resources for easier management. You can organize your resources based on their lifecycle or based on the applications they support. Resource Groups also enable you to manage access to resources at the group level.

Azure Availability Zones
Azure Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. They are designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance for your applications and services. Availability Zones are connected through high-speed and low-latency network connections.

Azure Virtual Networks
Azure Virtual Networks enable you to create isolated and secure networks in the cloud. They provide connectivity between Azure resources, on-premises resources, and the internet. You can also use Virtual Networks to define subnets, security rules, and routing tables.

Azure Load Balancer
Azure Load Balancer is a service that enables you to distribute incoming traffic across multiple virtual machines or services. It provides high availability and scalability for your applications by automatically routing traffic to healthy instances.

Azure Security
Azure offers several security features that help you secure your applications and data. These features include:

Azure Firewall: This service provides you with a managed firewall that protects your resources from unauthorized access.

Azure Security Center: This is a unified security management service that provides threat protection across your Azure resources.

Azure Active Directory: This service provides identity and access management for your Azure resources.

Azure Key Vault: This service enables you to safeguard cryptographic keys and other secrets used by your applications and services.

Azure Cost Management
Azure Cost Management is a service that enables you to monitor and optimize your Azure spending. It provides you with visibility into your usage and costs for different Azure resources, enabling you to track spending and identify areas for optimization. You can use Azure Cost Management to set budgets, create alerts for spending thresholds, and optimize resource utilization.

Azure DevOps
Azure DevOps is a suite of services that enables you to plan, develop, and deploy applications and services on Azure. It provides you with tools for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), code management, and project management. Azure DevOps integrates with a range of tools and technologies, including Visual Studio, GitHub, and Jenkins.

Azure IoT
Azure IoT is a set of services and technologies that enable you to connect, monitor, and manage Internet of Things (IoT) devices and data. Azure IoT includes services for device connectivity, data ingestion and processing, and analytics and visualization. With Azure IoT, you can build and deploy IoT solutions at scale.

Azure AI
Azure AI is a suite of services and tools that enable you to build intelligent applications and services. It includes services for machine learning, cognitive services, and bot services. With Azure AI, you can build applications that can see, hear, speak, and understand natural language, enabling you to create intelligent and personalized experiences for your users.

Azure Marketplace
Azure Marketplace is an online store for Azure services, solutions, and templates. It enables you to browse and discover pre-built solutions and services that you can use in your applications and services. Azure Marketplace includes a range of offerings, including software as a service (SaaS) applications, virtual machine images, and container images.

Conclusion

The Azure platform is a powerful and versatile cloud computing service that offers a wide range of services and features. Understanding the key concepts of Azure, such as cloud computing, Azure services, Azure Resource Manager, Azure subscriptions, Azure Resource Groups, Azure Availability Zones, Azure Virtual Networks, Azure Load Balancer, Azure Security, Azure Cost Management, Azure DevOps, Azure IoT, Azure AI, and Azure Marketplace, is essential for anyone studying for the Azure AZ-900 exam. With a solid understanding of these concepts, you will be well prepared to create, manage, and deploy applications and services on the Azure platform.
