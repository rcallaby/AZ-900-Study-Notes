# Authentication and Authorization

As more and more organizations move their IT infrastructure to the cloud, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the access to their resources is secure. This is where authentication and authorization come in. These are two fundamental concepts in cloud security that you need to know if you are studying for the AZ-900 exam, which is the entry-level certification for Azure cloud platform.

In this article, we will explain what authentication and authorization mean, how they work in Azure, and what you should know for the AZ-900 exam.

## Authentication in Azure Cloud Platform

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or application that is trying to access a resource. This is typically done by providing a set of credentials, such as a username and password, or a certificate. In Azure, there are several ways to authenticate:

+ Azure Active Directory (Azure AD): This is the default identity and access management service for Azure. It provides a centralized way to manage users and applications, and it supports different authentication methods such as passwords, multi-factor authentication, and certificates.

+ Microsoft Accounts: These are the personal accounts that users can create to access Microsoft services such as Office 365, Skype, and Xbox. Microsoft Accounts can be used to authenticate users to Azure resources as well.

+ Service Principals: These are non-human identities that are used to authenticate applications or services to Azure resources. They are commonly used in automated workflows and DevOps scenarios.

+ Managed Identities: These are Azure AD identities that are automatically managed by Azure. They are used to authenticate applications and services to other Azure resources.

+ External Identity Providers: These are third-party identity providers that can be used to authenticate users to Azure resources. Azure supports several identity providers such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter.

## Authorization in Azure Cloud Platform

Once a user or application is authenticated, the next step is to determine what they are authorized to access. Authorization is the process of granting permissions to a user or application based on their identity and the resource they are trying to access. In Azure, authorization is typically done using Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

+ Azure RBAC is a hierarchical model that consists of three main components:

+ Role Definitions: These are a set of permissions that define what actions a user or application can perform. There are several built-in roles in Azure such as Owner, Contributor, and Reader. These roles can be customized or new roles can be created as needed.

+ Role Assignments: These are the links between a user or application and a role definition. Role assignments can be made at different levels of the Azure hierarchy such as subscription, resource group, or resource.

+ Scope: This is the level at which the role assignment applies. It can be at the subscription level, resource group level, or resource level. Role assignments at a higher level of the hierarchy apply to all resources at a lower level, unless there is a conflicting assignment.

## Best Practices for Authentication and Authorization in Azure

To ensure the security of your Azure resources, there are several best practices that you should follow:

+ Use Azure AD for authentication: Azure AD provides a centralized way to manage users and applications, and it supports different authentication methods such as passwords, multi-factor authentication, and certificates.

+ Use Azure RBAC for authorization: Azure RBAC provides a granular way to manage permissions for users and applications, and it is integrated with Azure AD.

+ Use strong passwords: Ensure that passwords used for authentication are strong and complex, and are changed periodically.

+ Enable multi-factor authentication: Multi-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security by requiring a second factor such as a phone or token in addition to a password.

+ Use least privilege: This principle means that users and applications should only be granted the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of accidental or intentional misuse of resources.

+ Monitor and audit: Azure provides several tools for monitoring and auditing authentication and authorization activities. You should regularly review logs and alerts to detect and respond to potential security threats.

+ Implement network security: Network security measures such as firewalls and virtual private networks (VPNs) can help protect your resources from unauthorized access.

+ Keep software up to date: Ensure that all software and services used in Azure are up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

Authentication and authorization are essential components of cloud security in Azure. By using Azure AD for authentication and Azure RBAC for authorization, you can ensure that only authorized users and applications have access to your resources. Additionally, following best practices such as using strong passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication, and implementing network security can help reduce the risk of security breaches. By understanding these concepts and implementing best practices, you will be well prepared for the AZ-900 exam and be on your way to becoming an Azure expert.
