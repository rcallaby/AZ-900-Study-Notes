# Support

Azure Cloud computing is a rapidly growing field that provides scalable and efficient cloud services to businesses and individuals. As more organizations move their operations to the cloud, it has become increasingly important to have robust support services available to ensure smooth operations and timely resolution of issues.

## Types of Support in Azure Cloud Computing

Azure offers several types of support, including free and paid support plans, as well as community support. These support plans are designed to help customers resolve issues and optimize their Azure environment.

+ Free Support
Azure provides free support to all customers, regardless of their plan or subscription level. This support includes access to documentation, online forums, and other resources, such as whitepapers and webinars. The free support is limited to self-help resources and does not provide direct access to Azure support engineers.

+ Paid Support
Azure offers several paid support plans that provide varying levels of support based on customer needs. These support plans include:

* Developer Support: This is the lowest-tier support plan and is designed for developers who are testing and developing applications. It provides 24/7 technical support via email for critical issues, but does not include phone or chat support.

* Standard Support: This support plan provides technical support via email, phone, and chat. It also includes a guaranteed response time of two hours for critical issues.

* Professional Direct Support: This support plan provides technical support via email, phone, and chat, as well as access to a dedicated support team. It also includes a guaranteed response time of one hour for critical issues.

* Premier Support: This is the highest-tier support plan and provides customized support for customers with complex environments or business-critical applications. It includes a dedicated support team, on-site support, and a range of other services.

+ Community Support
Azure also offers community support, which includes access to user forums and discussion groups. This support is provided by other Azure users who may be able to provide guidance and support based on their experience. Community support is free and can be a valuable resource for users who need help with common issues.

## Relevance to the AZ-900 Certification Exam

The AZ-900 exam is designed to test a candidate's knowledge of basic cloud concepts and Azure services. The exam includes questions on Azure support and the different types of support available.

Candidates should have a basic understanding of the free and paid support plans offered by Azure, as well as the differences between them. They should also be familiar with the community support available and how to access it.

It is important to note that the AZ-900 exam does not test a candidate's ability to troubleshoot technical issues or interact with Azure support engineers. However, candidates should be able to identify the appropriate support plan based on a given scenario and understand the general process for engaging Azure support.

## Conclusion

Support is an important aspect of Azure Cloud computing, and Azure offers a range of support plans to meet the needs of its customers. Candidates studying for the AZ-900 certification exam should have a basic understanding of the different types of support available and their relevance to Azure Cloud computing. By familiarizing themselves with Azure support, candidates can better prepare for the exam and gain a deeper understanding of how to optimize their Azure environment.
