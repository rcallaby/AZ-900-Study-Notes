# Pricing

Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services to its customers. Azure pricing is a crucial aspect that anyone studying for the Azure AZ-900 exam needs to understand. In this article, we will cover the basics of Azure pricing, the various pricing models, and some tips on how to optimize your costs.

## Azure Pricing Basics

Azure pricing is based on a pay-as-you-go model, meaning you only pay for what you use. This approach is beneficial because it enables you to scale up or down based on your requirements, without incurring any additional costs.

One of the essential things you need to know about Azure pricing is that it is calculated based on the usage of services. Azure services are billed per-minute basis, so you pay only for the time you use. For example, if you use a virtual machine for ten minutes, you will be charged for only ten minutes, not an hour.

## Azure Pricing Models

Azure offers three pricing models that cater to different needs and budgets. These are:

Consumption-based pricing: This model charges you based on the actual usage of services. It is ideal for small businesses and startups that require flexibility and scalability.

Reserved Instance pricing: This model allows you to prepay for Azure services for one or three years, resulting in significant cost savings. It is ideal for businesses with predictable workloads and long-term projects.

Azure Hybrid Benefit: This model allows you to use your existing licenses for Windows Server or SQL Server on Azure at a discounted rate. It is ideal for organizations that have already invested in Microsoft licenses and want to extend their usage to Azure.

## Tips for Optimizing Azure Costs

Optimizing Azure costs is essential to ensure that you are not overspending on services you don't need. Here are some tips on how to optimize your Azure costs:

Monitor your usage: Monitoring your usage is crucial to identify services that are not being used, overutilized, or underutilized. You can use Azure Cost Management and Billing to monitor your usage and optimize your costs.

Use Azure Advisor: Azure Advisor provides recommendations to optimize your costs, security, and performance. You can use Azure Advisor to identify underutilized resources, configure auto-shutdown, and more.

Use Azure Reservations: Azure Reservations allow you to prepay for Azure services for one or three years, resulting in significant cost savings.

Use Azure Spot Virtual Machines: Azure Spot Virtual Machines offer up to 90% cost savings compared to regular virtual machines. They are ideal for non-critical workloads and batch processing.

Understanding Azure pricing is crucial for anyone studying for the Azure AZ-900 exam. Azure pricing is based on a pay-as-you-go model, and there are three pricing models: Consumption-based pricing, Reserved Instance pricing, and Azure Hybrid Benefit. Optimizing your Azure costs is essential to ensure that you are not overspending on services you don't need. You can use Azure Cost Management and Billing, Azure Advisor, Azure Reservations, and Azure Spot Virtual Machines to optimize your costs.
