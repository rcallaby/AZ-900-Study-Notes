# Storage

Azure is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft that offers a wide range of services for developing, deploying, and managing applications and services in the cloud. One of the key components of Azure is storage, which allows users to store and manage their data in a secure and scalable way. In this article, we will discuss the basics of Azure storage, its types, and the various features and benefits it offers, all from the perspective of someone studying for the AZ-900 exam.

## Overview of Azure Storage

Azure storage is a scalable and highly available cloud storage service that provides a variety of data storage options. It allows users to store, manage, and access their data from anywhere, at any time, using a variety of protocols and APIs. Azure storage is designed to provide high performance, scalability, security, and durability for storing and managing data.

## Azure storage offers four main types of storage services:

Blob Storage: Azure Blob storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, documents, and other files. It can store and serve large-scale datasets, including analytic data and data for mobile and web applications. It can be accessed through REST APIs, Azure SDKs, and client libraries for various programming languages.

File Storage: Azure File storage is a fully managed file share service that supports the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol for Windows and the Network File System (NFS) protocol for Linux. It is ideal for enterprise applications that require shared file access.

Queue Storage: Azure Queue storage is a messaging service that enables reliable messaging between application components. It is ideal for decoupling different parts of distributed applications.

Table Storage: Azure Table storage is a NoSQL key-value store that can store and retrieve large amounts of structured data. It is ideal for storing structured data, such as application settings, metadata, and user data.

Each of these types of storage has different pricing tiers, features, and use cases. In general, Azure storage provides the following features and benefits:

Scalability: Azure storage is designed to be highly scalable, enabling users to store and manage large amounts of data.

Availability: Azure storage provides high availability and durability, ensuring that data is always accessible and protected.

Security: Azure storage provides advanced security features, such as encryption, access control, and firewall protection, to ensure data is protected from unauthorized access.

Performance: Azure storage provides fast and reliable performance, ensuring that data can be accessed quickly and efficiently.

Cost-effectiveness: Azure storage is cost-effective, offering flexible pricing options and pay-as-you-go billing to suit different needs and budgets.

### Features of Azure Storage

Azure storage provides several features that make it easy to use and manage. Some of the key features include:

Blob-level Tiering: This feature allows users to tier their data based on usage patterns, with hot, cool, and archive tiers, allowing users to optimize storage costs.

Azure Backup: Azure Backup is a cloud-based backup and recovery solution that enables users to backup and restore data from on-premises systems and cloud-based applications.

Azure Site Recovery: Azure Site Recovery is a disaster recovery solution that enables users to replicate and recover workloads across different regions and datacenters.

Azure Import/Export: Azure Import/Export is a service that allows users to transfer large amounts of data to and from Azure using physical hard drives.

Azure Data Box: Azure Data Box is a service that enables users to transfer large amounts of data to Azure using a ruggedized appliance.

Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Management: This feature enables users to automate the management of their data, including moving data to different storage tiers and deleting data based on policy.

Azure Blob Storage Static Website

Azure Blob Storage Static Website: This feature allows users to host static websites on Azure Blob storage, providing a cost-effective and scalable solution for hosting simple web applications.

Azure Storage Explorer: Azure Storage Explorer is a free tool that enables users to easily manage and browse their Azure storage accounts and resources.

Azure Storage Analytics: Azure Storage Analytics provides detailed metrics and logs for monitoring and troubleshooting Azure storage resources.

Azure Storage Service Encryption: This feature encrypts data at rest using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption, ensuring that data is protected from unauthorized access.

Shared Access Signatures: Shared Access Signatures (SAS) provide a secure way to grant limited access to Azure storage resources, enabling users to control access to their data.

Azure Storage Firewalls and Virtual Networks: Azure Storage Firewalls and Virtual Networks allow users to control access to their storage accounts by defining network rules and IP address ranges.

## Benefits of Azure Storage for AZ-900 Exam
