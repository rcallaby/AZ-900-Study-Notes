# Monitoring and Management

Monitoring and management are crucial aspects of Azure cloud services that help ensure the availability, performance, and security of resources hosted in the cloud. As a candidate studying for the Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) exam, it's important to have a solid understanding of these concepts and how they relate to the Azure platform.

In this article, we'll explore monitoring and management in Azure from the perspective of an AZ-900 exam candidate. We'll cover the key concepts, tools, and services that you should be familiar with to pass the exam and effectively manage Azure resources.

## Key Concepts:

Before diving into specific tools and services, let's briefly review some key monitoring and management concepts that are relevant to Azure:

Metrics: Metrics are a fundamental aspect of monitoring in Azure. They provide insights into the health and performance of resources, such as CPU usage, network traffic, and storage capacity.

Alerts: Alerts are triggered when metrics exceed predefined thresholds, allowing administrators to quickly respond to issues and maintain the health of their resources.

Logs: Logs provide detailed information about events that occur within a resource or service, such as system errors, user activity, and security threats.

Automation: Automation involves using scripts and workflows to automate routine tasks and streamline management processes. In Azure, automation can be achieved using tools like Azure Automation and Azure Functions.

## Tools and Services:

With these concepts in mind, let's take a closer look at some of the key tools and services that you'll need to be familiar with for the AZ-900 exam:

Azure Monitor: Azure Monitor is a centralized monitoring service that provides a single interface for collecting and analyzing metrics and logs from Azure resources. It supports a wide range of resource types, including virtual machines, databases, and storage accounts.

Azure Log Analytics: Azure Log Analytics is a service that allows you to collect, analyze, and visualize logs from Azure resources and on-premises systems. It provides powerful querying and visualization tools to help you gain insights into your data.

Azure Resource Manager: Azure Resource Manager is a management framework that provides a consistent way to deploy, manage, and monitor resources across Azure. It allows you to group resources into logical units, called resource groups, and apply policies and tags to those groups for better organization and governance.

Azure Automation: Azure Automation is a service that allows you to automate routine management tasks using runbooks. Runbooks are scripts that can be triggered manually or scheduled to run automatically, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.

Azure Functions: Azure Functions is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code in response to events, such as HTTP requests or message queues. It can be used for tasks such as data processing, file manipulation, and integration with other Azure services.

Monitoring and management are critical aspects of Azure cloud services that help ensure the availability, performance, and security of resources. As an AZ-900 exam candidate, it's important to have a solid understanding of these concepts and the tools and services that Azure provides to support them. By familiarizing yourself with Azure Monitor, Azure Log Analytics, Azure Resource Manager, Azure Automation, and Azure Functions, you'll be well-equipped to pass the exam and effectively manage Azure resources.
