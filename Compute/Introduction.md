# Compute

The Compute module is an important component of the AZ-900 exam for the Azure Cloud Certification. This module covers various topics related to virtual machines, containers, and serverless computing in Azure. In this article, we will discuss these topics in detail.

## Virtual Machines (VMs):

Virtual Machines are a popular way to deploy and run applications in Azure. They are essentially emulated versions of physical servers that are hosted in the cloud. The Azure Virtual Machines service allows users to create and manage VMs in the cloud. With this service, users can create and deploy Windows or Linux-based VMs, configure them with custom software, and scale them up or down as needed.

The Azure Virtual Machines service also provides users with a wide range of pre-built images that they can use to quickly deploy VMs with common software and configurations. These pre-built images include images for popular Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS, as well as images for Windows Server and SQL Server.

In addition to the standard VMs, Azure also provides specialized VMs for specific use cases such as GPU-enabled VMs for machine learning and high-performance computing, and memory-optimized VMs for workloads that require large amounts of memory.

## Containers:

Containers are a lightweight alternative to VMs that allow users to run applications in isolated environments. They are often used for microservices-based architectures, where an application is broken down into small, independent services that can be developed and deployed independently.

Azure provides several services for container management and deployment, including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Container Instances (ACI), and Azure Container Registry (ACR).

AKS is a managed Kubernetes service that allows users to deploy and manage containerized applications in a fully managed environment. AKS automates many of the tasks involved in managing Kubernetes clusters, such as scaling and upgrades.

ACI is a serverless container platform that allows users to deploy containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. With ACI, users simply specify the container image they want to run, and Azure takes care of the rest.

ACR is a managed Docker registry that allows users to store and manage container images. With ACR, users can easily share container images between teams and environments, and can also scan container images for security vulnerabilities.

## Serverless Computing:

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure required to run an application, allowing developers to focus on writing code. In Azure, serverless computing is provided through several services, including Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps.

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows users to run code in response to events such as HTTP requests or changes in data. With Functions, users can write code in a variety of languages, including C#, Java, and Python.

Azure Logic Apps is a service that allows users to create workflows that integrate with other services in Azure and beyond. With Logic Apps, users can create workflows that perform tasks such as sending emails, creating calendar events, and processing files.

The Compute module of the AZ-900 exam for the Azure Cloud Certification covers a wide range of topics related to virtual machines, containers, and serverless computing in Azure. By understanding these topics, users will be able to deploy and manage applications in the cloud using a variety of different tools and services provided by Azure.
